# PRODIGY_DS_02 - Internship Task 2

This project is part of my Internship at Prodigy Infotech (Task 2).

## About the Project
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The aim was to understand the dataset, clean it, and extract meaningful insights through visualizations.

## Skills 
•⁠  ⁠Data cleaning and preprocessing
•⁠  ⁠Handling missing values
•⁠  ⁠Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
•⁠  ⁠Basic statistical analysis


## Project Highlights
•⁠  ⁠Filled missing values in the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns
•⁠  ⁠Analyzed survival rates based on gender, class, and age
•⁠  ⁠Visualized correlations between different features
•⁠  ⁠Generated clear and understandable plots
